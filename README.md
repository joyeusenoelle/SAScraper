# SAScraper
A thread scraper for the Something Awful forums

It's simple to run:

`python3 main.py %threadid%`

where `%threadid%` is from the URL of the thread you want to scrape. For example, to scrape the D&D Politoons thread, use:

`python3 main.py 3908778`

Each thread will go in its own folder under the `/archive` directory.
